OrtoIdiomas is my first version of the OrtoLearn: The Art Of War. An app made by me, to help everyone learn how to pronunciate in english. The first version is paid, but free ones will come.

How it was done:


I use and adapt a Text To Speech implementation: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts

![TTS_Implementation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0266730e-3a71-41a3-b9fa-cb76ffeda9b1)

It was modified to work with a set of pre-recorded audios. It works with both local and streaming audio:

An audio control was created to organize the audios and texts:
